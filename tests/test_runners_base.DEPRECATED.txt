# DEPRECATED TEST FILE

**Original File**: test_runners_base.py  
**Status**: DEPRECATED - Phase 5 cleanup  
**Date**: November 29, 2025

## Reason for Deprecation

This test file tests the OLD `runners/` architecture which has been replaced by the new `deployment/` architecture.

## Tests Replaced By

The functionality tested in this file has been replaced by:
- `tests/test_orchestration.py` - Tests BuildOrchestrator and RunOrchestrator
- Future: `tests/test_deployment.py` - Will test SlurmDeployment and KubernetesDeployment

## Action Required

This test file should be:
1. Reviewed for any unique test cases not covered by new tests
2. Deleted after verification
3. Replaced with deployment layer tests

## Old Tests Coverage

- NodeConfig dataclass
- WorkloadSpec dataclass  
- ExecutionResult dataclass
- DistributedResult dataclass
- BaseDistributedRunner abstract class
- RunnerFactory pattern

These concepts are replaced by:
- DeploymentConfig dataclass
- DeploymentResult dataclass
- DeploymentStatus enum
- BaseDeployment abstract class
- DeploymentFactory pattern
