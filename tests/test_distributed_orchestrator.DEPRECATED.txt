# DEPRECATED - test_distributed_orchestrator.py

**Status**: DEPRECATED (December 2024)  
**Reason**: DistributedOrchestrator class has been removed and replaced by new architecture

---

## Deprecation Notice

This test file (`test_distributed_orchestrator.py`) tests the **DEPRECATED** `DistributedOrchestrator` class which has been removed from the codebase.

### What Was Removed

- `src/madengine/tools/distributed_orchestrator.py` - Legacy orchestrator
- Tests in `test_distributed_orchestrator.py` - No longer applicable

### Replacement

The functionality has been split into:
1. **BuildOrchestrator** (`src/madengine/orchestration/build_orchestrator.py`)
2. **RunOrchestrator** (`src/madengine/orchestration/run_orchestrator.py`)

### Test Coverage

New test coverage is provided in:
- `test_orchestration.py` - Tests for BuildOrchestrator and RunOrchestrator
- `test_mad_cli.py` - Integration tests for madengine-cli using new orchestrators

---

## Migration Guide

If you need to understand how the old DistributedOrchestrator worked:

**Old Pattern:**
```python
from madengine.tools.distributed_orchestrator import DistributedOrchestrator

orchestrator = DistributedOrchestrator(args)
orchestrator.build_phase()
orchestrator.run_phase()
```

**New Pattern:**
```python
from madengine.orchestration.build_orchestrator import BuildOrchestrator
from madengine.orchestration.run_orchestrator import RunOrchestrator

# Build phase
build_orch = BuildOrchestrator(args)
manifest = build_orch.execute()

# Run phase
run_orch = RunOrchestrator(args)
results = run_orch.execute(manifest_file=manifest)
```

---

## Action Required

**No action required** - This file serves as documentation only.

The test file `test_distributed_orchestrator.py` can be safely deleted after verifying that:
1. `test_orchestration.py` provides equivalent coverage
2. `test_mad_cli.py` covers integration scenarios
3. All CI/CD pipelines pass with the new tests

- GPU tool manager architecture (ROCm/NVIDIA)
- ROCm 6.4.1 threshold (PR #54)
- Separation of build and run concerns
- Improved error handling and logging
